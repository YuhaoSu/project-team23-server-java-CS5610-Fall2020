We were unable to get our http session working remotely on Heroku and, as such, we are currently running both the client and the server on the local host while the database is remote via ClearDB MySQL. As the database is remote, thereâ€™s no need to recreate our database schema and data. Please clone and run our java server locally as normal and run our react client locally by typing npm start on the command line. The react client should be running on http://localhost:3000/ while the java server on http://localhost:8080/
